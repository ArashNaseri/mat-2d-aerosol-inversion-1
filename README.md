This program was largely written and compiled by Timothy Sipkens
([tsipkens@mail.ubc.ca](mailto:tsipkens@mail.ubc.ca)) while at the
University of British Columbia.

This distribution includes code snippets from the code provided with
the work of Buckley et al.
([https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaerosci.2017.09.012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaerosci.2017.09.012)), who used a Twomey-type approach
to derive two-dimensional mass-mobility distributions.

Also included is a reference to code designed to quickly evaluate
the transfer function of particle mass analyzers (e.g. APM, CPMA) by
Sipkens et al. (Under review).

Information on the provided colormaps can be found in an associated
README in the `cmap` folder.
