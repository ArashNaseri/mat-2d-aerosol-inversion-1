# Perceptually improved colormaps for MATLAB

*Last updated: November 19, 2019*

These `.mat` files contain the colormaps from four primary sources:

1. *cmocean* - Kristen M. Thyng, Chad A. Greene, Robert D. Hetland, Heather M. Zimmerle,
and Steven F. DiMarco. True colors of oceanography: Guidelines for effective
and accurate colormap selection. Oceanography, September 2016.  
http://dx.doi.org/10.5670/oceanog.2016.66 (More information is available at
https://matplotlib.org/cmocean/).

2. *matplotlib* - Colormaps designed by St√©fan van der Walt and
Nathaniel Smith. (More information is available at https://bids.github.io/colormap/).

3. *colorbrewer2* - Colormaps by Cynthia Brewer and Mark Harrower. (More information
  available at http://colorbrewer2.org/).

4. *turbo* - A. Mikhailov. Turbo, An Improved Rainbow Colormap for Visualization.
(More information is available at https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/08/turbo-improved-rainbow-colormap-for.html).

When loaded directly, the colormaps will appear as the variable `cm` in the
workspace. Otherwise `load_cmap` can be used to load the colormap specified
by a string, `str`, containing the colormap name. The function `load_cmap`
also takes `n` as a second input, which can be used reduce or increase (by interpolation)
the number of colors in the colormap, while still respecting the color order.

It is also noted that the *deep*, *dense*, *matter*, and *tempo* colormaps
are reversed from their original order, such that the darker color is
always first.

The colormaps, and swages indicating their color progression, are included below.
